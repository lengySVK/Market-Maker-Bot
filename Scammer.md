Be cautious of these scammers. The live bot is not the same as the one used in the testnet and does not generate the profits shown in their videos. They constantly promise updates but are essentially selling a non-functional bot. They're also offering 'flash sales' with discounted prices. When asked for refunds, they stopped responding. I've reported this to their payment gateway to identify the individuals behind the scam, as they should have completed KYC verification.
